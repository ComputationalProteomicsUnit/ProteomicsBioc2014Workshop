[Bioc2014](https://register.bioconductor.org/BioC2014/) workshop on R / Bioconductor packages for Proteomics
=============================================================

This workshop will give delegates the opportunity to discover and try
some of the recent R / Bioconductor developments for
proteomics. Topics covered will including support for open
community-driven formats for raw data and identification results,
packages for peptide-spectrum matching, quantitative proteomics, mass
spectrometry (MS) and quantitation data processing, and
visualisation. The workshop material will be a self-contained
vignette/workflow including example data.
