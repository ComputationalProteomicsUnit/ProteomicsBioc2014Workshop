Description: This workshop will give delegates the opportunity to
	     discover and try some of the recent R / Bioconductor
	     developments for proteomics. Topics covered will
	     including support for open community-driven formats for
	     raw data and identification results, packages for
	     peptide-spectrum matching, quantitative proteomics, mass
	     spectrometry (MS) and quantitation data processing, and
	     visualisation. The workshop material will be a
	     self-contained vignette/workflow including example data.
