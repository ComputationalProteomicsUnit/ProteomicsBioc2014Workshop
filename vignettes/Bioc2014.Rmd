**Abstract** This workshop will give delegates the opportunity to
discover and try some of the recent R / Bioconductor developments for
proteomics. Topics covered will including support for open
community-driven formats for raw data and identification results,
packages for peptide-spectrum matching, quantitative proteomics, mass
spectrometry (MS) and quantitation data processing, and
visualisation. The workshop material will be a self-contained
vignette/workflow including example data.

This short tutorial is part of the `ProteomicsBioc2014Workshop`
package (version `r packageVersion("ProteomicsBioc2014Workshop")`),
available at
https://github.com/ComputationalProteomicsUnit/ProteomicsBioc2014Workshop.

## Introduction

```{r, pk, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
biocv <- as.character(biocVersion())
pp <- proteomicsPackages(biocv)
msp <- massSpectrometryPackages(biocv)
msdp <- massSpectrometryDataPackages(biocv)
```

In Bioconductor version `r biocv`, there are respectively `r nrow(pp)`
proteomics and `r nrow(msp)` mass spectrometry software packages and
`r nrow(msdp)` mass spectrometry experiment packages. These respective
packages can be extracted with the `proteomicsPackages()`,
`massSpectrometryPackages()` and `massSpectrometryDataPackages()` and
explored interactively.


```{r, pp, eval=FALSE}
library("RforProteomics")
pp <- proteomicsPackages(biocv)
display(pp)
```

## Mass spectrometry data

```{r, datatab, results='asis', echo=FALSE}

datatab <-
    data.frame(Type = c("raw", "identification", "quantitation",
                   "peak lists", "other"),
               Format = c("mzML, mzXML, netCDF, mzData",
                   "mzIdentML", "mzQuantML", "mgf", "mzTab"),
               Package = c(
                   "[`mzR`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/mzR.html) (read)",
                   "[`mzID`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/mzID.html) (read)",
                   "",
                   "[`MSnbase`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSnbase.html) (read/write)", 
                   "[`MSnbase`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSnbase.html) (read/write)"))
kable(datatab)

```

### Getting data from proteomics repositories

Contemporary MS-based proteomics data is disseminated through the
[ProteomeXchange](http://www.proteomexchange.org/) infrastructure,
which centrally coordinates submission, storage and dissemination
through multiple data repositories, such as the
[PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/) data base at the EBI for
MS/MS experiments, [PASSEL](http://www.peptideatlas.org/passel/) at
the ISB for SRM data and the
[MassIVE](http://massive.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/massive.jsp)
ressource. The
[`rpx`](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rpx.html)
is an interface to ProteomeXchange and provides a basic and unified
access to PX data.

```{r, rpx}
library("rpx")
pxannounced()
```

```{r, pxd}
px <- PXDataset("PXD000001")
px
pxfiles(px)

```

Other metadata for the `px` dataset:

```{r, pxvar, eval=FALSE}
pxtax(px)
pxurl(px)
pxref(px)
```

Data files can then be downloaded with the `pxget` function as
illustrated below. Alternatively, the file is available on the
workshop's Amazon virtual machine in `/data/Proteomics/data/`.

```{r, pxget}
mzf <- "TMT_Erwinia_1uLSike_Top10HCD_isol2_45stepped_60min_01.mzXML"
mzf <- file.path("/data/Proteomics/data", mzf)
if (!file.exists(mzf))
    mzf <- pxget(px, pxfiles(px)[6])
mzf
```

### Handling raw MS data

The `mzR` package provides an interface to the
[proteowizard](http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/) code base,
the legacy RAMP is a non-sequential parser and other C/C++ code to
access various raw data files, such as `mzML`, `mzXML`, `netCDF`, and
`mzData`. The data is accessed on-disk, i.e it does not get loaded
entirely in memory by default. The three main functions are
`openMSfile` to create a file handle to a raw data file, `header` to
extract metadata about the spectra contained in the file and `peaks`
to extract one or multiple spectra of interest. Other functions such
as `instrumentInfo`, ro `runInfo` can be used to gather general
information about a run.

```{r, rawms}
library("mzR")
ms <- openMSfile(mzf)
ms
```

```{r, hd}
hd <- header(ms)
dim(hd)
names(hd)
```

#### Exercise

Extract the index of the MS2 spectrum with the highest base peak
intensity and plot its spectrum. Is the data centroided or in profile
mode?

```{r, ex_raw, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
hd2 <- hd[hd$msLevel == 2, ]
i <- which.max(hd2$basePeakIntensity)
hd2[i, ]
pi <- peaks(ms, hd2[i, 1])
plot(pi, type = "h")
mz <- hd2[i, "basePeakMZ"]
plot(pi, type = "h", xlim = c(mz-0.5, mz+0.5))

pj <- peaks(ms, 100)
plot(pj, type = "l")
plot(pj, type = "l", xlim = c(536,540))
```

### Handling identification data

The `RforProteomics` package distributes a small identification result
file (see
`?TMT_Erwinia_1uLSike_Top10HCD_isol2_45stepped_60min_01.mzid`) that we
load and parse using infrastructure from the 
[`mzID`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/mzID.html)
package.

```{r, id, cache=TRUE}
library("mzID")
(f <- dir(system.file("extdata", package = "ProteomicsBioc2014Workshop"),
         pattern = "mzid", full.names=TRUE))
id <- mzID(f)
id
```

Various data can be extracted from the `mzID` object, using one the
accessor functions such as `database`, `scans`, `peptides`, ... The
object can also be converted into a `data.frame` using the `flatten`
function.

#### Exercise

Is there a relation between the length of a protein and the number of
identified peptides, conditioned by the (average) e-value of the
identifications?

```{r, ex_id, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
fid <- flatten(id)
x <- by(fid, fid$accession, function(x)
    c(unique(x$length),
      length(unique(x$pepseq)),
      mean(x$'ms-gf:specevalue')))
x <- data.frame(do.call(rbind, x))
colnames(x) <- c("plength", "npep", "eval")
x$bins <- cut(x$eval, summary(x$eval))
library("lattice")
xyplot(plength ~ npep | bins, data = x)
```

### MS/MS database search

While searches are generally performed using third-party software
independently of R or can be started from R using a `system` call, the
[`rTANDEM`](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rTANDEM.html)
package allows one to execute such searches uwing the X!Tandem
engine. The
[`shinyTANDEM`](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/shinyTANDEM.html)
provides a interactive interface to explore the search results.

```{r, rtandem, eval=FALSE}
library("rTANDEM")
?rtandem
library("shinyTANDEM")
?shinyTANDEM
```


## High-level data interface

The above sections introduced low-level interfaces to raw and
identification results. The
[`MSnbase`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSnbase.html)
package provides abstractions for raw data through the `MSnExp` class
and containers for quantification data via the `MSnSet` class. Both
store the actual assay data (spectra or quantitation matrix) and
sample and feature metadata, accessed with `spectra` (or the
`[`, `[[` operators) or `exprs`, `pData` and `fData`.

The figure below give a schematics of an `MSnSet` instance and the
relation between the assay data and the respective feature and sample
metadata.


```{r, msnset, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 7, fig.align='center'}
plot(NA, xlim = c(0, 5), ylim = c(0, 10), axes=FALSE, xlab = NA, ylab = NA)
rect(0, 0, 3, 1.9)
rect(0, 2, 3, 10)
rect(3.05, 2, 5, 10)

segments(seq(0, 3, length.out = 7),
         rep(0, 7),
         seq(0, 3, length.out = 7),
         rep(10, 7),
         lty = "dotted")

segments(rep(0, 50),
         seq(2, 10, length.out = 50),
         rep(5, 100),
         seq(2, 10, length.out = 50),
         lty = "dotted")

text(1.5, 1, "sample metadata", cex = 1.5)
text(1.5, 6, "assay data", cex = 1.5)
text(4, 6, "feature\nmetadata", cex = 1.5)
```

Another useful slot is `processingData`, accessed with `processingData(.)`, that records all the processing that objects have undergone since their creation (see examples below).

The `readMSData` will parse the raw data, extract the MS2 spectra and
construct an MS experiment file.

```{r, msnbase}
library("MSnbase")
quantFile <- dir(system.file(package = "MSnbase", dir = "extdata"),
                 full.name = TRUE, pattern = "mzXML$")
quantFile
msexp <- readMSData(quantFile, verbose=FALSE)
msexp
```

The identification results stemming from the same raw data file can
then be used to add PSM matches.

```{r, addid}
## find path to a mzIdentML file
identFile <- dir(system.file(package = "MSnbase", dir = "extdata"),
                 full.name = TRUE, pattern = "mzid$")
identFile
msexp <- addIdentificationData(msexp, identFile)
fData(msexp)
```

```{r, specplot, fig.align='center'}
msexp[[1]]
plot(msexp[[1]], full=TRUE)
as(msexp[[1]], "data.frame")[100:105, ]
```

### Quantitative proteomics

There are a wide range of proteomics quantitation techniques that can
broadly be classified as labelled vs. label-free, depending whether
the features are labelled prior the MS acquisition and the MS level at
which quantitation is inferred, namely MS1 or MS2. 

```{r, quanttab, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

qtb <- matrix(c("XIC", "Counting", "SILAC, 15N", "iTRAQ, TMT"),
              nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
dimnames(qtb) <- list(
    'MS level' = c("MS1", "MS2"),
    'Quantitation' = c("Label-free", "Labelled"))

kable(qtb)

```

In terms of raw data quantitation, most efforts have been devoted to
MS2-level quantitation. Label-free XIC quantitation has however been
addressed in the frame of metabolomics data processing by the
[`xcms`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/xcms.html)
infrastructure. 


An `MSnExp` is converted to an `MSnSet` by the `quantitation`
method. Below, we use the iTRAQ 4-plex isobaric tagging strategy
(defined by the `iTRAQ4` parameter; other tags are available).

```{r, itraq4plot, fig.align='center'}
plot(msexp[[1]], full=TRUE, reporters = iTRAQ4)
```

```{r, quantitraq}
msset <- quantify(msexp, method = "trap", reporters = iTRAQ4, verbose=FALSE)
exprs(msset)
processingData(msset)
```

Other MS2 quantitation methods available in `quantify` include the
(normalised) spectral index `SI` and (normalised) spectral abundance
factor `SAF` or simply a simple count method.

```{r, lfms2}
exprs(si <- quantify(msexp, method = "SIn"))     
exprs(saf <- quantify(msexp, method = "NSAF"))
```

Note that spectra that have not been assigned any peptide (`NA`) or
that match non-unique peptides (`npsm > 1`) are discarded in the
counting process.

**See also** The
[`isobar`](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/isobar.html)
package supports quantitation from centroided `mgf` peak lists or its
own tab-separated files that can be generated from Mascsot and Phenyx
vendor files.

### Importing third-party data

The PSI `mzTab` file format is aimed at providing a simpler (than XML
formats) and more accessible file format to the wider community. It is
composed of a key-value metadata section and petide/protein/small
molecule tabular sections. 

```{r, mztab}
mztf <- pxget(px, pxfiles(px)[2])
(mzt <- readMzTabData(mztf, what = "PEP"))
```

It is also possible to import arbitrary spreadsheets as `MSnSet`
objects into R with the `readMSnSet2` function. The main 2 arguments
of the function are (1) a text-based spreadsheet and (2) column names
of indices that identify the quantitation data.

```{r, readmsnset2}
csv <- dir(system.file ("extdata" , package = "pRolocdata"),
           full.names = TRUE, pattern = "pr800866n_si_004-rep1.csv")
getEcols(csv, split = ",")
ecols <- 7:10
res <- readMSnSet2(csv, ecols)
head(exprs(res))
head(fData(res))
```

## Data processing and analysis

### Processing and normalisation

Each different types of quantitative data will require their own
pre-processing and normalisation steps. Both `isobar` and `MSnbase`
allow to correct for isobaric tag impurities normalise the
quantitative data.

```{r, pure}
data(itraqdata)
qnt <- quantify(itraqdata, method = "trap",
                reporters = iTRAQ4, verbose = FALSE)
impurities <- matrix(c(0.929,0.059,0.002,0.000,
                       0.020,0.923,0.056,0.001,
                       0.000,0.030,0.924,0.045,
                       0.000,0.001,0.040,0.923),
                     nrow=4, byrow = TRUE)
## or, using makeImpuritiesMatrix()
## impurities <- makeImpuritiesMatrix(4)
qnt.crct <- purityCorrect(qnt, impurities)
processingData(qnt.crct)
```


```{r, pureplot, fig.align='center'}

plot0 <- function(x, y, main = "") {
    old.par <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)
    on.exit(par(old.par))
    par(mar = c(4, 4, 1, 1))
    par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
    sx <- sampleNames(x)
    sy <- sampleNames(y)
    for (i in seq_len(ncol(x))) {
        plot(exprs(x)[, i], exprs(y)[, i], log = "xy",
             xlab = sx[i], ylab = sy[i])
        grid()
    }
}

plot0(qnt, qnt.crct)
```

Various normalisation methods can be applied the `MSnSet` instances
using the `normalise` method: variance stabilisation (`vsn`), quantile
(`quantiles`), median or mean centering (`center.media` or
`center.mean`), ...

```{r, norm, fig.align='center'}
qnt.crct.nrm <- normalise(qnt.crct,"quantiles")
plot0(qnt, qnt.crct.nrm)
```

The `combineFeatures` method combines spectra/petides quantitation
values into protein data. The grouping is defined by the `groupBy`
parameter, which is generally taken from the feature metadata (protein
accessions, for example).

```{r, comb}
## arbitraty grouping
g <- factor(c(rep(1, 25), rep(2, 15), rep(3, 15)))
prt <- combineFeatures(qnt.crct.nrm, groupBy = g, fun = "sum")
processingData(prt)
```

Finally, proteomics data analysis is generally hampered by missing
values. Missing data imputation is a sensitive operation whose success
will be guided by many factors, such as degree and (non-)random nature
of the missingness. Missing value in `MSnSet` instances can be
filtered out and imputed using the `filterNA` and `impute` functions.

```{r, impute, fig.align='center'}
set.seed(1)
qnt0 <- qnt
exprs(qnt0)[sample(prod(dim(qnt0)), 10)] <- NA
table(is.na(qnt0))
qnt00 <- filterNA(qnt0)
dim(qnt00)
qnt.imp <- impute(qnt0)
plot0(qnt, qnt.imp)
```

#### Exercise

The `mzt` instance created from the `mzTab` file has the following is
a TMT 6-plex with the following design:

   In this TMT 6-plex experiment, four exogenous proteins were spiked
   into an equimolar *Erwinia carotovora* lysate with varying
   proportions in each channel of quantitation; yeast enolase (ENO) at
   10:5:2.5:1:2.5:10, bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 1:2.5:5:10:5:1,
   rabbit glycogen phosphorylase (PHO) at 2:2:2:2:1:1 and bovin
   cytochrome C (CYT) at 1:1:1:1:1:2. Proteins were then digested,
   dierentially labelled with TMT reagents, fractionated by reverse
   phase nano ow UPLC (nanoACQUITY, Waters), and analysed on an LTQ
   Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientic).

Explore the `mzt` data using some of the illustrated functions. The
heatmap and MAplot (see `MAplot` function), taken from the
[`RforProteomics`](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/RforProteomics.html)
vignette, have been produced using the same data.

### Statistical analysis

R in general and Bioconductor in particular are well suited for the
statistical analysis of data. Several packages provide dedicated
ressources for proteomics data:

- [`MSstats`](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSstats.html):
  A set of tools for statistical relative protein significance
  analysis in DDA, SRM and DIA experiments.

- [`msmsTest`](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/msmsTests.html):
  Statistical tests for label-free LC-MS/MS data by spectral counts,
  to discover differentially expressed proteins between two biological
  conditions. Three tests are available: Poisson GLM regression,
  quasi-likelihood GLM regression, and the negative binomial of the
  edgeR package.

<!-- ```{r, msmstest} -->
<!-- library(msmsTests) -->
<!-- data(msms.dataset) -->
<!-- msms.dataset -->
<!-- e <- pp.msms.data(msms.dataset) -->
<!-- e -->
     
<!-- null.f <- "y~batch" -->
<!-- alt.f <- "y~treat+batch" -->
<!-- div <- apply(exprs(e),2,sum) -->
<!-- res <- msms.edgeR(e,alt.f,null.f,div=div,fnm="treat") -->
     
<!-- head(res) -->
<!-- ``` -->

- [`isobar`](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/isobar.html)
  also provides dedicated infrastructure for the statistical analysis of isobaric data. 

### Machine learning

The
[`MLInterfaces`](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MLInterfaces.html)
package provides a unified interface to a wide range of machine
learning algorithms. Initially developed for microarray and
`ExpressionSet` instances, the
[`pRoloc`](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/pRoloc.html)
package enables application of these algorithms to `MSnSet` data.

```{r, ml}
library("MLInterfaces")
library("pRoloc")
library("pRolocdata")
data(dunkley2006)
traininds <- which(fData(dunkley2006)$markers != "unknown")
ans <- MLearn(markers ~ ., data = t(dunkley2006), knnI(k = 5), traininds)
ans
```

```{r, clust, fig.align='center'}
kcl <- MLearn( ~ ., data = dunkley2006, kmeansI, centers = 12)
kcl
plot(kcl, exprs(dunkley2006))
```

```{r, clust2, fig.align='center'}
hcl <- MLearn( ~ ., data = t(dunkley2006), hclustI(distFun =  dist, cutParm = list(k = 4)))
hcl
plot(hcl, exprs(t(dunkley2006)))
```


## Annotation

All the
[Bioconductor annotation infrastructure](http://bioconductor.org/help/workflows/annotation/annotation/),
such as
[`biomaRt`](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/biomaRt.html),
[`GO.db`](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/GO.db.html),
organism specific annotations, .. are directly relevant to the
analysis of proteomics data. Some proteomics-centred annotations such
as the PSI Mass Spectrometry Ontology, Molecular Interaction (PSI MI
2.5) or Protein Modifications are available through the
[`rols`](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rols.html). Data
from the [Human Protein Atlas](http://www.proteinatlas.org/) is
available via the
[`hpar`](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/hpar.html)
package.

## Other relevant packages/pipelines

- Analysis of post translational modification with `isobar`.
- Analysis of label-free data from a Synapt G2 (including ion
  mobility) with `synapter`.
- Analysis of spatial proteomics data with `pRoloc`.
- Analysis of MALDI data with the `MALDIquant` package.

Additional relevant packages are described in the
[`RforProteomics`](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/experiment/html/RforProteomics.html)
vignette.
